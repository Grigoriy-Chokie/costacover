If you don't measure correctly, you could end up with mismatched panels or wallpaper that's too small (or large) for your walls. And believe us, that's a headache you don't want to deal with.\n\nSo, how do you go about measuring your walls for wallpaper? Well, it depends on the shape of your wall. Walls are typically rectangular, but they can also be slanted or have obstacles in them (like a window or door). In this guide, we'll walk you through how to measure each type of wall.\n\nBut before we get started, there are a few things you'll need: a tape measure, a level, a pencil, and some paper.<\/p>",
